# Random-Number-
Program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.

If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.”

If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.” 

The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. 

Finally store that number in a file with a keyword "Guessed random number": here_number.

Additionally i did that how many guesses it tooks to find actual random number.

Attached Screenshot clearly depicts the result of the given program.
